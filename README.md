## Problem statement
- Rock Bees (Apis dorsata) are among the largest honey bee species and play a vital role in pollination and honey production. However, their aggressive defensive behavior makes their presence near human settlements a significant safety concern. Increasing urbanization and lack of awareness have led to frequent human–bee conflicts, often resulting in the destruction of entire colonies. This has contributed to a decline in Rock Bee populations and loss of ecological balance. There is currently no simple system to identify, track, and monitor the locations of Rock Bee colonies. Hence, a mobile-based Rock Bee colony detection and monitoring application is needed to promote early awareness and enable safe coexistence between humans and bees.
